They had a colleague at one of the museums associated with the University of Lorraine that wanted to incorporate NLP into their work. \n",

The project consisted of improving the search engine they had for their digital collections of 18-th century letters, which at that time only used metadata (date of publication, author, receiver, language, etc ), and now they wanted to also use the content of the letters. \n",
