I added those programs that either currently were Erasmus programs, or that had recently been Erasmus programs (because they tend to also have local funding).\n\nI made a Google Sheet of my own ranking of countries, from high (5) to low (1)."

The topics ended up including philosophical logic, mathematical logic, foundations of mathematics, computation, linguistics, constructed languages, what the hell do A.I. and M.L do?, what’s the role of proofs and programs? and so on. Eventually, he mentioned something called “Computational linguistics”, that nobody was quite sure what it meant, but it was a field in development.\nThis conversation made me realized that Applied Mathematics was something I could do, but that had moderate interest for me, and that my long dormant interest for languages was still there. Not only that, I was presented with a field that had a component from Humanities (through linguistics) and a component from mathematics (through programming), which was not Economics! (sorry, economists!) Even better, the field offered the chance to mix industry and research without necessarily going into academia.\n\nIf I just could find a Master’s in that area…."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nBy the time I left Nancy (August 2022), all COVID restrictions had been lifted.\n\n\nEven though France is one of the countries where the antivax movement was the strongest, their vaccination campaign against COVID is widespread and covers foreigners without many hussles.\nUpdate: This post has been updated with information up to May 2022, when COVID restrictions have been almost fully lifted in the whole of France.\n\nTesting\nWhen I arrived to Nancy (September 2022), antigene testing was available in most pharmacies. Now, as the months have passed, it is only available in the most centric ones.\nIf you have a Carte Vitale, you can get antigen tested for free, otherwise, you have to pay 25€.\nThe results are available through a website (they’ll tell you which one there) in at most one hour, and from there you can download a certificate of a negative result.\nTo get a PCR test, one has to go to a laboratory. I got one at “Atoutbio”, close to the Gare.\n\n\nGetting vaccinated\nI arrived to Nancy without being vaccinated yet, not due to lack of will but due to delays in my country. Anyway, the good news is that you don’t need to be registered in the French healtcare system to get vaccinated!\nIt is enough to book an appointment at a vaccination center through Doctolib (you may need a French phone number though!), where you can even select which vaccine you’d prefer, if it is available (I got Pfizer).\nThe first dose will be the most complicated to get. Take your passport to the appointment, you will be asked for your Carte Vitale, but it is enough to tell them that you do not have it yet. In my case, they called in a supervisor to sort out my situation: They gave me some papers stating that I was being registered for vaccination at that center. It is very important to take these papers to get the next doses.\nThen I went in for vaccination, showed the doctors the papers I had just got, and was ready to head out after 30 minutes.\nNote: Just before leaving the vaccination center, there are some people in charge of generating the certificate of vaccination. It is better if you talk to them and ask them to email it to you or print it there. Why? Because normally this certificate would be available through the website of the French healthcare system, and since you’re not registered yet, you will not get it on that website. If you forget to get it, you have to go back to the vaccination center and ask for it. This vaccination certificate has a QR you can use to get your Passe Sanitaire.\nThe second and third doses need basically the same procedure. Each dose generates a new certificate of vaccination.\n\n\nPasse Sanitaire\nThe Passe Sanitaire was a proof of vaccination required to enter some public places. France implemented it through the app TousAntiCovid (all against COVID), available for Android and iOS.\n\nTo activate the Passe Sanitaire, there are two options:\n\nA temporary activation: This is done with a certificate of a negative result for a test.\nA permanent activation: This is done with a vaccination certificate.\n\nBoth of these certificates contain a QR code which can be scanned to get a Passe Sanitaire. The application will generate a QR which can be used as proof of vaccination.\nThe QRs from this application also work abroad! I have used the permanent Passe Sanitaire as proof of vaccination when travelling to other countries in Europe!\n\n\nForeign vaccinations\nWhat if you have been already vaccinated abroad?\nIf you have been vaccinated with one of the vaccines recognized by the European Union, you just have to take your proof of vaccination to any pharmacy. There they will generate a French vaccination certificate for you. I have not done this myself, this is what I have heard from other students.\nIf you have been vaccinated with one of the vaccines not recognized by the European Union (like the Russian Sputnik 5), you will have to get vaccinated in France."

Luckily, there are tons of materials and tutorials available online.

And it’s close to the Residence Batelière!\n\n\n\nFresh fruits and spices\nOn the weekends there is an Arab street market in front of the T2 Station Cèdre Bleu.\nThis is where I got most of my fruits, because it was the only place I found where spices and fruits with real taste were affordable. They have great prices (for France) and variety.\nThey only set shop on Sundays from 9AM to 1PM. Around noon it gets really crowded. During the summer, they also work on Saturdays.\n\nYou can also try your luck at the international section of the biggest Auchan in Nancy:\n\n\nIt is at the end of the T2 bus line."

    "text": "Moving from Nancy to Donostia (Spain)\nThis was my case. After researching a lot of possibilities, I decided to book trains and take advantage of the fact that Donostia is very close to the French border. My route was the following:\n\nFrom Nancy to Paris Gare de l’Est station by train. 1.5 hours on the fast train (or 4 hours on the regional train).\nFrom Paris Gare de l’Est station to Paris Montparnasse station using the Metro line 4 (the purple one). 1 to 2 hours.\nFrom Paris Montparnasse to Hendaye on the fast train. 4 hours.\n\nHendaye is a town right at the Spanish-French border.\n(It is amazing that you can cross France on fast train in 4 hours!)\n\nFrom Hendaye to Donostia via tram. Less than one hour.\n\nThat’s how I was able to move in one day and in a single trip, here’s some details about the journey:\n\nFor these train tickets, I used discount cards and booked two months in advance to get amazing prices (I moved for less than 100€).\nTrains don’t have luggage limits, and you can look for trains that allow bikes.\nThe most uncomfortable part of the journey is taking the Paris Metro.\n\nThere is an entry to the metro station inside Gare de l’Est but it is always crowded. It is easier to go outside and find another entrance.\n\nIt takes a while to find an elevator, and the station is not friendly for carrying luggage.\nThe rumors about the Paris metro are true: it smells really bad\n\nThe fast trains have a cart that sells snacks, but they’re very pricey.\nJust after heading out from the Hendaye train station, you will see the tram station to Donostia.\nThe tram from Hendaye to Donostia costs around 6 €.\nThe border police may check your documents before boarding the tram.\nI left Nancy around 8 AM and was in Donostia around 5 PM.\n\nNote:\n\nIf you prefer to move by bus, then I strongly recommend that you avoid transferring in Paris. Why? Because you will have to transfer at Paris-Bercy bus station, which is a very sketchy and unsafe place.\n\nFor bus, I would recommend the following route: Nancy &gt; South of France (Lyon, Montpellier, or Marseille) &gt; Barcelona &gt; Donostia."

Once validated, the same ticket can be used for up to one hour, meaning you can transfer as many times as you want within that hour without being charged extra.\nThere is also a ticket valid for 10 rides for about 11 €, I have found this ticket to be the most convenient for those living close to the center.\nThere are also subscription cards that can be bought at the Gare (Main station). Since I live close enough to the center, I have managed really well without a subscription card.\n\n\nSchedules\nThe tram and the buses in Nancy normally come every 10 minutes. Many bus stops, but not all of them, have a screen showing when the next bus is coming.\nGoogle Maps works really well with the public transport in Nancy!\nHowever, there are days when protests (manifestations) perturb the normal functioning of the public transport system. This is most common during the weekends.\nSTAN is the official app of the public transport in Nancy, and it is updated with information about any detours or irregularities. Personally, I find it is not user friendly, and I have managed to live here without using it. The STAN Twitter is also useful.\n\n\nFree on weekends\n\nOn Saturday and Sunday, the local public transport system can be used for free!\n\nThis is one of the coolest features in Nancy!\nThere are different schedules, though: - On Saturday, buses come every 20 minutes - On Sunday, buses come every 10 minutes"

There are signs showing where bikes are supposed to go:\n\n\nOutside the city center, it is more common to find special lanes for bikes, far away from car traffic.\n\n\n\n\nBuying a bike\nI bought my second-hand bike through the website Leboncoin (“the good corner”) for around 90 €.\n\nThere is also the Association Dynamo, a collective for the sustainable use of bikes. They have cheap second-hand and refourbished bikes.\n\n\n\n\nBike repair\nThe Association Dynamo, just mentioned above, is a very good place for fixing your bike.\nIn their shop, you have to repair your bike yourself. They have every tool you could ever need, and there is always someone (normally another student) to guide you along the process. They also usually have at least one person that can speak English.\nTo get to use the shop, you have to subscribe for 17 € for a whole year (student price). It is a really good price! From my experience, fixing a bike in a private shop can easily start in 30 €, becoming more expensive really quickly.\n\n\n\n\nRenting a bike\nNancy has VéloStan, a bike rental service. To rent a bike you need to have a European bank account.\nThey only have stations around the center of the city, so they are not really usefull for exploring the city.\n\n\nBiking rules\nAs withh many rules in France, on the one hand there is what the law says, and on the other hand there is what people actually do in daily life.\nThe rules for biking within a city are - to always use a helmet - use a bright yellow vest at night (so that cars can see you) - drive only in bike lanes - only zones marked with ‘30 km/h’ can be used by bikes in any sense of traffic\nBut in reality, the French are more flexible, from what I’ve seen: - around half of bikers use helmets - only some bikers use yellow vests at night - bikers normally also use the sidewalks - bikers use any road in both senses of traffic\n…and no one seems to bait an eye about that. Apparently, as long as you are not putting anyone else in danger and have some common sense about moving in traffic, people will tolerate bad biking."

Your consulate will produce this document, with the official seal of the consulate, and this should be equivalent to a birth certificate produced and apostilled in your country. If you are lucky, they will produce the document in the local language, otherwhise, you will have to get an official translation, and an Apostille for this translation."

This is important for Erasmus Mundus students that will move between countries of the European Union.\nFor example, imagine that you want to present a criminal record from France to the Spanish authorities. Then, at the moment of requesting the document (most bureaucracy of this kind can be done online), you also have to request a supplementary form for France. This supplementary form is a translation guide so that the Spanish authorities can read the French document. If you preesent the French document together with its supplementary form, then you do not need to get an Apostille nor a translation."

    "text": "How did I get into my master? Sometimes I don’t even know\n\nI got accepted into the Language and Communication Technologies Erasmus Master, and many times I wonder if the committee made a mistake. Yep, impostor syndrome is my way of life for now.\n\n\n\nI studied at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, the least catholic place in all of Peru and most forward thinking place in the country, a place truly dedicated to education, something remarkable when most universities in my country strive to be employee factories, but I digress….\n\nMy major was Mathematics. (wait, don’t run!)\nThough it was not my first option, I choose to major in Mathematics in order to learn how to learn, and along the way I worked a little in Control Theory, but my mathematical passion was in Mathematical Logic. One of the best decisions of my life :)\nNow, you may think this makes a good segway into being good at Computer Science, but in fact I hated it. Or at least hated so much how it was taught to me, that I never bothered to learn it right.\nIn reality, I learned Mathematics through a “pen and blackboard” approach. Hopefully one day my professors will catch up with technology, but not in the foreseeable future. That’s a result from the fact that being a mathematician is a very low-risk profession (I mean physically, not economically).\nDuring my studies I got to do exchanges in Germany and Mexico, and summer courses in Brazil and U.S.A (funny, because summer in Brazil is from December to March, and in the USA it is from June to September)\nAll of this must sound amazing/impressive/intimidating, right? Well, only academically. My personal reality was really bad. For most of the time I was really depressed, my personal relationships where unattended, and I retracted to my own thoughts, which of course only worsened this cycle.\nAs it happens, doing Mathematics was a sort of good escapism: Reasoning about abstract concepts/objects helped me forget my problems and realize that there was beautiful stuff in life.\nThat must sound really strange, how can intangible stuff have an effect on someone? (that’s a weird segway into Benacerraf’s dilemma in the philosophy of Mathematics!)\nThe short version is that it was like looking at the sea for a long time: the vastness and uncaring-ness of what you’re looking at is something that makes you realize that your problems are temporary, while the sea is not.\nI also realized that Mathematics Academia was not a place for me: though I really like doing math, I also have other interests. I also wanted to have some savings before enrolling in graduate school, in order to not life off scholarships for many years.\nAnd so, my graduation was at the end of 2018, with me not really knowing what I was going to do with my life.\n\n\n\n\nOver the course of my life, I have always had an interest on human languages. When I was little, I would end up on Wikipedia for hours reading about how Basque is a language isolate, how some languages use clicks, constructed languages, reconstructed langauges, and so on, and on, and on….\nBeing from the Peruvian coast, Spanish is my first language. The majority of Peruvians are monolinguals in Spanish, and so my upbringing was also like that. Sad, in a country with more than 30 indigenous languages.\nFirst I studied English while I was around 13 to 16. My family insisted in registering me at a well-known English institute because of some non-sensical reasons like “having a good CV”. That institute was a waste of time and a money extractor for aspirational Peruvian families. I truly learned English watching stuff I really liked on Youtube, and then using English books for university.\nFor some years I tried to learn Ancient Greek at university. That’s when I started attending classes at the Philosophy department. Though I studied really hard, I can hardly remember much now about the language itself, though it had it’s advantages:\n\nGreek made me go through the pain of learning a language with a case system, which was useful for the future\nI’m no longer intimidated by non-latin scripts\n\nSecond I studied German when I was around 18. After a short 1-week journey to Germany I romanticized the country and wanted to study there in the future. That was the exchange I made when I was 21. Living there 6 months helped de-romanticize it, and I learned that every place has its own problems.\nAfter studying German, the language-learning vice was already on motion.\nThird I studied Quechua, the Ayacucho/Chanka variety, this is still in progress. Before you get surprised about that, after almost 4 years studying it on and off (too few people to get classes to open), I’d say my level is still around A2-B1, keeping conversations is hard, I always forget the vocabulary, and can only read a couple of lines at a time. My reason for studying it was that I would not get a good chance to learn it if I left Peru. Learning it I saw the face of Peru that won’t show on tourism ads: the social stigma against indigenous languages is strong in our classist peruvian society. I had to pay for the classes myself and I studied it in secret, because my parents had very strong negative opinions about that “language of peasants”.\nFourth I studied Portuguese. My main motivation here was that the program lasted a year and that that gave me a chance to study in Brazil. That was the summer course in made in Rio de Janeiro. Now, to many people that sounds idyllic, but the reality is different: Rio de Janeiro is the most unequal place I’ve been to yet. Venturing outside the “Zona Sul” (South Zone, that’s where all the famous beaches are) is where you’ll see the true face of a strongly socioeconomically divided country. On the good side, long lasting friendships where made there :)\nFifth I started studying Latin, this is still in progress. My method is the wonderful Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata as a self learner. That’s where I got the title for this blog btw, “quiêscêns” is the participle present of “quiêscere”, which roughly translates to “to relax, to leisure”, so “quiêscens” means something like “the one who relaxes/leisures”. I’m studying it because of all the tradition in philosophy and mathematics that’s originally in Latin, but also as a relaxing exercise.\nSixth I started studying French, this is still in progress. To be honest, I have been indifferent to French culture all my life: I don’t get why the media romanticizes it (specially USA media). Then, why did I started studying it? Well, I started after being accepted to my Master, the LCT program, and being assigned for my first year to the University of Lorraine. I’ve then realized that the francophone countries of Africa look like really cool places to do some linguistics though.\n\n\nMy goal is to get to be really fluent in 10 languages :)\n\n\n\n\nThe three months after my graduation where very tense: my savings were diminishing and I needed to find a “real job”.\nAs it happens, some friends at university worked at Wolfram Research. After talking with some of the guys there, they recommended me to attend the Wolfram Summer School at Boston, USA. It lasted three weeks and was weirdly intellectually satisfying and socially challenging. The other participants were brilliant people from everywhere, and I made some lasting and non-lasting friendships there. The social issue was on me, because I put too much pressure on myself to “keep up with the rest”, which hindered my mental peace. Oh, how I wish I had known that!\nAfter returning from the Summer School, I had an interview with the guy in charge of Wolfram Research South America, and the hired me.\n\nThose first months at Wolfram were very strong in imposter syndrome for me. I had no idea how to behave in a job environment, I had never programmed seriously (with a product for users in mind), and I got assigned a project strongly related to Computer Science (oh my!).\nThankfully, the environment and the people there were very relaxed, so my main source of stress was my own pressure to hide that I had no idea what I was doing.\nWith the months, I learned more and more, it was really in my second year that I got more confidence in my work.\nThat’s when the pandemic arrived, and home-officing started. Working with all the mental load and uncertainty of the first months of quarantine was horrible. I hope never to be in that situation again.\nAfter some months I asked to be relocated to a project more related to Linguistics, and my time there improved amazingly. Yeah, my algorithms where not very efficient, and some stuff had to be done manually, but I got it to work and even solved some bugs from many years ago! I did not notice the hours nor was as stressed as before in this new project.\nThen, some weeks ago, I quit my job in order to make all the bureaucracy for starting the Masters.\n\n\n\nThough I will tell the complete story in another post, the summary is that I wanted to find a place where I could be “in both worlds” : Humanities + Sciences\nI searched for a lot of places, like economics, to no result, I didn’t really see myself doing that.\nAnd one happy day, a friend told me about Computational Linguistics. This conversation started being about Logic and Philosophy of language, but when he started describing some ideas of the field, it was music to my ears.\nIn Computational linguistics I saw the chance to combine three interests\n\nHumanities, through the social and philosophical sides from Linguistics\nSciences, through the Mathematics involved in technology (and that too many engineers gleefully are not aware of!)\nLanguages\n\nPlus the bonus of an allegedly good job market.\nThat’s how I started searching for masters in Computational Linguistics, and eventually came upon Language and Communication Technologies Erasmus Master\n\n\n\nThese are the things that I have meant to learn for a long time, because they would be helpful for my masters:\n\nI have no idea about Python, R, or SQL\nI have never done anything with machine learning\nComputer Science (data structures and algorithms) make me wanna puke\nProgramming seriously is still very difficult for me\nI don’t have a formal education on Linguistics\nI need more social confidence to work in groups\n\nI’m really self-conscious about all of these.\nAm I complaining that I have not yet learned the things I’ll learn in the Masters? Sometimes I think that, but worrying about that kind of stuff is my specialty (not healthy, I know, I’m working on it).\nSo yeah, that’s partially me."

Additionally, due to COVID, there were very few flights available.\nAlso due to COVID, the idea of making transfers was very unattractive, because each country had their own conditions for entry. Thus, I had to look up direct flights.\nI ended up buying a 1000 USD plane ticket for an AirFrance flight from Lima to Paris.\nWithouth a doubt, under pre-COVID conditions this would not have been so expensive.\nMy flight arrived at Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG), which is huge. I needed to keep this in mind when buying tickets to get to Nancy.\n\n\nTickets to Nancy\nThe SNCF is the French public railway company.\nIn their website, also available in English, I bought my tickets to Nancy.\nI bought tickets for the Highspeed train TGV (train à Grande Vitesse) and then transferred to a bus to Nancy, all for 70 €\nMy schedule was the following: - A TGV from CDG airport to the Lorraine-TGV station (between Nancy and Metz), around 3 hours.\n\nA bus from the Lorraine-TGV station to the Nancy Gare (Nancy main station), around half an hour.\n\nAccording to that schedule, I would arrive in Nancy around 5pm.\nThe Lorraine TGV:\n\n\nNancy Gare:\n\n\n\n\nDocuments required at the Airport\nBecause of COVID, to enter France it was not enough to have a French Visa. Flights were restricted to those “with a good reason for travelling” and that were not at risk of having COVID.\nThe (printed) documents required to get into the flight were:\n\nA PCR test with negative result done in the last 48 hours. I got it in a lab for around 60 USD.\nA sworn declaration of having no COVID symptoms.\nA sworn declaration saying I had good reasons for travelling (I selected “Studies”).\n\nThese two last documents (in French!) could be downloaded from a website from the French Government, by Googling “entrance to France for foreigners COVID”.\n\n\nMoney exchange\nWeeks before travelling, I started exchanging my money into Euros. I did it in medium sized batches of money, so I waited for moments with good exchange rates to exchange each batch.\nI found one bank in my country that made international transfers in Euros at a flat rate: it was the same price independent of the amount of Euros sent!\nHowever, I did not have a European bank account. Since I already had a trusted friend living in the European Union, me and them talked about the possibility of a transfer. I sent them the money in two batches, and each transfer took approximately four days to transfer.\nAdditionally, since I did not know how long creating a bank account would take, I took a bunch of cash with me (around 2000 €).\n\n\n\nSaying farewell\nMost of the times when I was not doing any bureaucracy, I took to say goodbye to my friends in person.\nThe uncertainty of not knowing when (and if) I would see them again was heavy.\nWith all its faults, online communication helps at least a little.\nI got to see people I had not seen in years.\nGood times.\nNow the big day was getting closer."

In any case, the website is really user-friendly and will guide you in everything you need.\n\nAs an LCT student with a scholarship, my situation was “Student without employment”\nThen you will be prompted to a list of necessary documents:\n\n\nThey also explain what they mean by a “vital record”:\n\n\nThe “vital record” I used was my birth certificate in Spanish.\n\n\nAfter the prompt with all the necessary documents, you will be asked to create an account. Here, a French phone number is necessary.\nThen you will be asked to upload the documents. If you don’t have one available, you can always log in later to upload it.\n\nSo, one mistake I made here was to wait until I had a bank account number (which took approximately one month) to start with the procedure. As the instructions on the website point out, there are two stages to get registered: - getting a provisional social security number - getting a definitive social security number\nIt would have been faster for me if I had uploaded the documents for the provisional number as soon as I arrived in France. It is only after getting the provisional number that the process for a definitive number starts, so, I really did not have to wait until I had all the necessary documents for the definitive number.\nAnyway, after uploading the documents, you will see a “Processing” sign next to them. With this, the initial registration is done, and now you have to cross your fingers wishing they don’t take long to process them."

This was even slower with those documents written in a non-Latin script.\n\nProvisional numbers start with 7, and once you get them you can go to the doctor. However, you will have to pay full price out-of-pocket, which is 25 € for an appointment with a general practitioner (I don’t know how much specialists charge). After that, there is a process where you can mail the receipt and some form in order to be partially reimbursed (I never had to do that because my definitive number didn’t take that long to arrive).\nOnce, you get a definitve number, it is way easier to go see a doctor."

As I had not been working for more than a year by the time I applied to the Complementaire, the Erasmus scholarship was my only income.\n\nSince I was a foreign student in France, I had not payed any taxes ever in France, so I had to write a sworn declaration stating that fact. I used a simple model:\n\n\n\nCode\n\"\"\"\nAttestation sur l’honneur de non-imposition\n\nJe soussigné &lt;M./Mme MY LAST NAME my name&gt; demeurant &lt;my address&gt;,\nAtteste sur l’honneur ne pas être soumis à l’impôt au titre des revenus de l’année 2020/2021.\nPour faire valoir ce que de droit\n\nA Nancy, le ________________\n\n\"\"\";\n\n\nIt roughly says “I declare under oath that I have not been subject to taxation during the years 2020/2021”\nAfter having all the documents ready, I put them in an envelope and went with a francophone friend to the CPAM. There they told me to just deposit it on a box they had outside the building. Since I did not have an appointment, they told me they could not help me verify if my application was complete.\nLuckily, two months after this, I got a notification on my Ameli.fr account showing that my application had been accepted!\nTo start using the Complementaire it is necessary to go to a Pharmacie (see below) and ask for them to update your Carte Vitale. This only takes a few seconds.\nFinally, when I went to another medical appointment, I had to pay from my own money but was reimboursed within a week!"

    "text": "If you come to Lorraine for your first year of the LCT, you will most likely do your thesis and internship during your second year, that is, at your Year 2 University, so you should check their requirements. The University of Lorraine will not make a fuss about an internship or thesis in the first year, because it is not part of the credits necessary for the M1 Program. Remember, the workload of the first year is too heavy! However, what you can do is a Summer Internship at the end of the first year.\nIn France, summer internships are usually done between June and August. Since the Summer Semester at the University of Lorraine technically ends at the end of August, it is very difficult to have a summer internship going beyond this date\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnically, to have a summer internship going into September, you’d have to do two summer internships, for example, one from July to the last day of August, and one from the first day of September, till October. This involves more paperwork.\n\n\n\n\nTo keep in mind\n\nSummer internships in France are paid (not a lot, though)\nThe University of Lorraine will not recognize it for ECTS credits\nThat means, you cannot have a summer internship recognized for the LCT\nYou cannot do your thesis on a summer internship\nGiven that they are short internships, they consist in very specific projects\nIt is very difficult to get a summer internship at a company\nCheck your work benefits, like paid vacation days\nYou don’t have to pay taxes on your internship salary\n\nWith all this in consideration, students get summer internships for two main reasons:\n\nTo make some extra money during the summer\nTo do a small research project on something that interests you\n\n\n\nHow to get a summer internship?\nThe easiest way to get one of these internships is to ask your professors for small projects. They may also know some other professor with a project!\nKeep in mind that the earlier you start looking for a summer internship, the better chances you have. Do not be afraid to approach your professors!\n\n\nThe paperwork\nIn order to start a summer internship, there is some bureaucratic ping-pong you have to go through. At the end, the company/organization and the university sign an agreement that allows you to work as an intern.\n\nFirst, the Secretary of the IDMC sends you the agreement for you to sign\nThen, you have to send it to the company/organization for them to sign\nThen, the company/organization has to send the agreement to the Secretary to be checked\nThen, you have to show you have appropriate insurance: “responsabilité civile”\n\nThe insurance from the LCT program or the insurance you used to rent your accomodation should be fine.\n\nThen, the agreement is signed by the head of the IDMC and the Master’s coordinator.\nThen, the final agreement is sent to you.\nThen, the final agreement is sent to the company/organization.\n\n\n\nMy case\nI did a summer internship from the beginning of July till the end of August 2022. After asking one of the professors in a course that I really liked if they had any project, they came back after a few weeks with an answer. They had a colleague at one of the museums associated with the University of Lorraine that wanted to incorporate NLP into their work.\nThe paperwork was not very complicated because the museum was part of the University, and they paid me minimum salary for internships, which was around 600€/month. Especifically, all the paperwork was done online via email. I have heard that for companies or organizations outside of the University, sometimes the paperwork has to be done via physical mail.\nThe internship was at the Henri Poincare Archive, a museum and research center on history of science and mathematics. The project consisted of improving the search engine they had for their digital collections of 18-th century letters, which at that time only used metadata (date of publication, author, receiver, language, etc ), and now they wanted to also use the content of the letters.\nI was tutored by a PhD student doing their thesis there. After some unsuccessful attempts to use topic modeling, I used a SPARQL database, spacy, and formal concept analysis to finish the project.\nThe first month was in person, and the second month was remote (because everybody goes on vacation in August and the buildings of the University close), and they were ok with me traveling around.\nBy the end, I had to write a short report and make a presentation, and that was it."

    "text": "Proof of accomodation\nTo get a Visa, the French Embassy needs to know that you will have a place to stay.\nSo, how to get this? I found out about three ways to go about this.\n\nOption 1: Letter from the Coordinator\nThis is by far the easiest way of getting something that you can give to the French Embassy. I didn’t know about it until after my Visa appointment and I really wish I had.\nBasically, you ask the LCT Local Coordinator in France to write a letter, or to modify the Admission Letter to the University of Lorraine, saying that they promise to get you accomodation.\n\n\nOption 2: Promising you will look for accomodation\nThis is the option I took.\nBasically, one writes a letter in French to the Consul at the French Embassy saying that you’ll be at a specific place while you wait for your definitive residence.\nI booked a room at a hotel in Nancy for two weeks at booking.com, with free cancellation. After I got my Visa, I cancelled the reservation.\nBefore reading the letter, note: - “CROUS” is the name of the French insitution in charge of Student Residences. More to be explained in a future post. - I only booked for two weeks because that was the longest period the website allowed. - I printed and attached the booking confirmation to my dossier.\nMy letter to the French consul was:\n\n\nCode\n\"\"\"\n&lt;My name&gt;\n&lt;My address&gt;\n&lt;My City&gt;\n\nLe &lt;Date&gt;\n\nObjet : lettre explicative concernant les conditions de mon hébergement en France \nles trois premiers mois de mon séjour.\n\nMonsieur le consul,\n\nJe prends la liberté de vous fournir quelques explications relatives à mes \nconditions d’hébergement en France durant les trois premiers mois de mon séjour.\n\nDurant cette période, je serai hébergé à l’hôtel &lt;Name of the hotel&gt; se trouvant \nà l’adresse suivante &lt;Address of the hotel&gt; et dont le numéro de téléphone est \n&lt;telephone number of the hotel&gt;, le temps de me voir attribuer une chambre dans \nune résidence universitaire par l’intermédiaire du CROUS.  Dans l’hypothèse où \nj’obtiendrais une réponse négative de la part du CROUS, je me mettrai à la \nrecherche d’un appartement à louer dans le secteur privé, en passant par une \nagence immobilière ou un site de petites annonces et ce en utilisant mes moyens \nfinanciers personnels.\n\nJe joins à la présente ma réservation d’hôtel. Même si maintenant ma réservation \nest pour deux semaines, dans l’hypothèse où j’obtiendrais une réponse négative \nde la part du CROUS, je le prolongerais de trois mois.\n\nJe vous prie d’agréer, Monsieur le Consul général, l’expression de ma \nrespectueuse considération.\n\n\n\n&lt;Signature&gt;\n__________________________\n\n\"\"\";\n\n\nA translation (Remember the letter must be sent in French!) would be along the lines of:\n\n\nCode\n\"\"\"\n&lt;My name&gt;\n&lt;My address&gt;\n&lt;My City&gt;\n\nOn the &lt;Date&gt;\n\nSubject: Explanation letter regarding the conditions of my accomodation in Frence \nduring the first three months of my stay\n\nMr. consul,\n\nI am taking the liberty of providing you some explanations concerning my accomodation \nconditions in France during the first three months of my stay.\n\nDuring this period, I will be lodged at the hotel &lt;Name of the hotel&gt; which can be \nfound at the following address &lt;Address of the hotel&gt; and whose phone number is \n&lt;telephone number of the hotel&gt; during the time that it takes for me to receive a \nroom at a student residence via the itermediary CROUS. In the case where I were to \nobtain a negative response from CROUS, I will start searching for an accomodation to \nrent on the private sector, either through an immobiliary agency or through a renting \nwebsite, using my personal financial means.\n\nI attach to this letter my hotel reservation. Even if now my reservation is only for \ntwo weeks, in the case where I were to obtain a negative response from CROUS, \nI will extend it for three months.\n\nI ask you to accept, Mr General Consul, my respectful greetings\n\n&lt;Signature&gt;\n__________________________\n\n\"\"\";\n\n\n\n\nOption 3: Proof of acceptance into a Student Residence\nThis is a nightmare.\nYou will find online that this is the standard procedure for getting a proof of accomodation. It is very long and convoluted, you will have to do it at some point so that you actually get into a Student Residence, but it is possible to apply for the visa without it (see Options 1 and 2 above).\nThis issue will have it’s own post, but in summary, there is a bureacractic loophole that makes going through the standard process of applying to a student residence very difficult for those who are not already residing in France.\nAll the LCT Students of my batch tried to do it for months, but we gave up. Ultimately most went for Option 1.\nIn my case, I tried to get to use this option unsuccessfully, and while searching online for alternatives, I found out about Option 2 in an official website of the French Government. That’s why I went for Option 2. If I had known Erasmus Mundus students had Option 1 available, I would have used that one."

    "text": "Applying to LCT\nAfter deciding I wanted to do a Master’s degree and searching for a Master’s to apply to, I finally had to actually apply to the LCT Master’s.\n\nThe LCT website has a dedicated platform for application.\nEverything in this post is about the application for the 2020 student batch. (Because of COVID I had to defer)\n\n\nTo note:\n\nThe application opened around November 2019 and finished around February 2021. I applied two weeks before the final deadline.\nAt the time you apply to this Master’s, simultaneously you’re also applying for the Erasmus scholarship, you don’t have to do a separate application.\nThe application consists of 7 steps. Each time you complete a step, you cannot go back, so be careful. If you make a mistake, you will have to leave the application halfway done, message the LCT contact (to be found in the website), and start the process again using a new email.\nThe application is completely online. If your original documents are not in English, you also need certified translations.\nFor the TOEFL, only official scores sent by ETS are accepted.\n\n\nYou should prepare all your documents\n\n\n\nSteps 1, 2, 3\nThis steps are about your general information:\nPassport, Bachelor’s degree, transcript of courses, English certificate.\n\n\nStep 4\nHere you give information about your academic background.\nYou specify which was your major, and make a summary of your course transcripts.\nThey’ll ask you to pick up the courses that you think are relevant for the Master’s, group them, and then estimate what percentage of the maximum note you achieved.\nFor example: I had three programming courses with their respective grades “Intro to CS 18/20”, “C Language 17/20”, “Algorithms 11/20”.\nThus I grouped them into a category “CS&Algorithms” with percentage (90% + 85% + 55%)/3 = 76%\nAdditionally, in step 4 you specify your previous relevant experiences, be it work or research.\n\n\nStep 5\nHere you, optionally, specify your preferred universities for the Master, but you also have to give a small argument about why you’re preferring them.\n\n\nStep 6\nIn this part you specify the emails for your letters of reference. You need 2 contacts.\n\n\nStep 7\nHere is where the Motivation Letter goes.\nAdditionally, you can specify further qualifications that may be relevant, like language certificates, scholarships, grants, etc.\nYou have to write a one line summary of the professional career you’d like.\n\n\nHidden step:\nPrepare a Residence certificate from your own country: This is an official document that states your address in your own country. In my country, luckily, one can fill a sworn declaration independently by filling a form online. Of course, this has to be translated to English. Every country has its own procedure for getting one of those.\nWhy is that necessary? For getting an scholarship, one has to certify the place where one was living, to determine the scholarship amount. This certificate needs to be dated before the application deadline for the master.\n\nGood luck!"

    "title": "Nancy: Living at Residence Batelière",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This post is an overview of common life at Residence Batelière.\n\n\nThe Room\nI have already shown pictures of my empty room at Batelière in a previous story.\n\nRevelant things from that post were:\n\nRent is 418 €\nStudio Rooms are 18 square meters (bigger than most other residences)\n\n\n\nInside the Residence Batelière\nThe Residence Batelière has capacity for around 250-300 students in four floors, following the European scheme, there is a 0-th floor (the ground floor) and four floors on top of it.\nTechnically, the Residence is in the Maxéville district of the city, but it is just two blocks away from the city center border.\nThe official address is:\n7 à 15 Route de Metz \n54320 Maxéville\n\nHowever in Google Maps you will find it under 7-15 Rue de Metz, 54320 Maxéville.\n\nEntrances\nThe main entrance can only be opened by the staff at the reception or with a student card. Student cards from students from other residences won’t work.\n\nThere is also a back door, which can be opened only with a room key. This door is normaly used by\n\nstudents who have not yet received their student card\nstudents in bikes\n\n\n\n\nFor bikes\nAfter entering through the back door, there are two places to leave it:\n\nThe bike cage, which can only be opened with a room key\n\n\n\nBike parking in the backyard\n\n\n\n\nThe backyard\nWhen it is not cold outside, the backyard is a nice place in the back of the residence for hanging out, having a picnic, having a cigarrette, and chilling in general.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reception, mail and packages\nThe residence’s reception is on the ground floor, just to the left of the main entrance. Here’s where one pays the rent.\nJust next to the reception one can find the mailboxes. Getting packages that cannot fit into the mailboxes can be problematic. Medium and big-sized packages may be accepted or rejected at the reception, depending on who is there when the mailman arrives. If they accept the package at the reception, the staff usually sends you a message to pick it up ASAP. If they reject the package, it is usually sent back.\nBecause of this, I have found more convenient to send medium and big-sized packages to pick-up locations (there is a lot of them around Nancy: Amazon lockers, some tabacs, post offices, etc.)\n\n\n\nElevator\nWhen I arrived the elevator was out of service for three weeks. However, after it was repaired, it has been working fine for months.\n\n\n\nLaundry room\nOne can only enter the laundry room with a room key. There are two washing machines and two dries, which is not enough!\nThe washing cycle usually lasts 40 minutes and the drying cycle 60 minutes, which leads to long lines during popular times (like Saturday afternoon, all of Sunday). It is better to find a whole in your schedule and use it for doing laundry.\n\nPayment is done by credit card (even non-European cards work!) or by student card. Payment by student card needs IZLY, an app for loading your student card with money, that I will explain in a future post.\nThe price for the washing cycle is 3.20 € with credit card and 3.00 € with student card, and for the drying cycle is 1.00 €.\n\n\nThere are also free pads and tampons in the laundry room:\n\nNote: In the middle of the Winter semester, one of the driers broke. This caused long queues, and it took the administration 3 months to repair it!\n\n\nTrash room\nThe smell is pretty bad. It is not mandatory to segregate the garbage.\n\n\n\nCommon room\n\nDue to COVID restrictions, the common room was closed during all the time I was here.\n\n\nNoise hours\nNoise is not allowed after 10pm. In my experience, as long as it is not loud music or thumping, they will turn a blind eye. Either way, be empathic, there are other students around!\n\n\nRepairs\nIf something breaks or stops working in your room, it is really easy (and free!) to ask for repairs. One has to fill a form in a website from the CROUS Lorraine. Normally it takes 3 to 5 days for a handyman to come, though sometimes he can arrive in 1 day. In the form, you can give your consent so that the handyman can come into your room even if you are not there.\n\n\n\n\nClose to the Residence Batelière\nOther than the IDMC (see map just below), the Residence Batelière is decently close to most things one could need.\n\n\n\nSupermarkets\nFor this subsection I will copy and paste information I have mentioned in a previous post about my first days in France.\nThere are a couple of supermarkets within reasonable distance of Residence Bateliêre.\n\nLidl is a European supermarket chain know for its very low prices, and luckily, there is one very close to the Residence Batelière, just two blocks away: \n\nThey don’t have much variety, but the prices are good and you can find there most of the basic stuff.\nPlus, that specific Lidl close to Batelière is one of the few supermarkets that opens on Sunday (until midday)!\n\nCarrefour is a French supermarket chain, they have more variety than Lidl but their prices are a little higher (not crazy high though).\n\nThere is one Carrefour about four blocks away from Residence Bateliêre:\n\n\n\nFinally, there is an ALDI, another European supermarket brand with cheap prices, about ten blocks away from the residence.\n\nSince their products are basically the same as those in Lidl, I never buy at that ALDI.\n\n\n\n\nBus stops\nThere is a bus stop just in front of the Residence. However, the lines passing by this bus stop are not that well connected.\n\nThere is a bus stop for bus route T2 (one of the main bus routes in Nancy) a 10 minute walk from the residence.\nNote that the routes shown by Google Maps are longer!

Don’t let the stereotypes win! You may see some people that look sketchy or shady from time to time, but don’t worry, it is safe at all times to walk through for both men and women.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBanks\nThere are a couple of banks close to the residence, in a zone called Trois Maisons (three houses):\n\nBNP Parivas\nCrédit Agricole\nCaisse d’Epargne\nCrédit Mutuel\nCIC\n\n\n\n\n\nThe canal\nA really nice place to take a walk, run, or bike. It goes through the whole city. If you are lucky, you will get to see ducks and swans chilling in the canal.\n\n\n\n\nCROUS Leopold (student restaurant)\nThis is the student restaurant closest to both Residence Batelière and the IDMC. One pays by credit card, by student card, or with the IZLY app (to be explained in a future post).\n\n\n\n\nKebab stores\nIn Northern Europe, Turkish and Arabic fast food is cheap and easy to find. There are a couple of Kebab/Shawerma spots close to Residence Batelière.\n\nNote that by “cheap” I mean around 7 € for each meal.\n\nJust search “kebab” in Google Maps and you will find a bunch of them in the city. Around four kebab shops are within walking distance (&lt; 20 min.) from Batelière.\n\n\nPharmacies\nThere is a pharmacy in front of the Lidl, and another one in front of the T2 bus stop Jean L’Amour.\n\n\nTrain noise\nThere are train tracks behind the residence. Most of them are far away enough, but there is a side of the residence which is close to them. In this part of the building, there’s train noise all day long, try to avoid it!\n\n\nThings not close to the Residence\nPlaces that are not within short walking distance of the Residence:\n\nno other restaurants\nno bars\nno big parks\nno good gyms"

We had to mail the files directly to the email of the Residence Batelière. We did it, but then they were taking long to answer and our travel dates where approaching, so one of the LCT students managed to find out who was in charge of assigning the rooms at the Residence Batelière, and we sent our files to that person.

    "section": "",
    "text": "General migration advise\nFrom my experience traveling to a couple of places, here are the things that I’ve found useful to know\n\n\nDocument everything\nYou don’t want to loose an important document and re-do bureaucracy to get it again, right?\nIf some document is needed in any part of some bureaucracy for your trip, then take photocopies and/or scans with you. Do this as soon as you get the document, don’t wait until you need the document in the future. Your future self will thank you.\nA good file management system is a blessing, it has saved me in moment where I had to suddenly present a document. This is how I do it: For physical documents you could group them in different batches, use color coding, etc… while for digital documents you could organize them in folder by place and bureaucratic process.\nFor example: “2021in Narniaapplicationcertificate with Narnian translation.pdf”\nThis {website for working with PDFs](https://tools.pdf24.org/en/) has helped me a lot of times (merging, cutting, page extraction, compressing, etc).\n\nWithout good documentation:\n\n\n\nWith good documentation:\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s your name?\nDifferent languages use different naming conventions for people. Find out how to put your name in the convention of where you are going, and stick to it.\n\nI’ll give an example for Spanish into French.\n\n\nThe Spanish language convention for names:\nShakira’s name at birth was “Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoli”. She’s from Colombia, a Spanish speaking country, so she uses the Spanish language convention for names.\nIn this convention, a person’s full name has four parts: two simple names and two family names.\n\nA First name: Shakira\n(Optional) One or more middle names: Isabel\nA First family name, traditionally it’s the First family name of the father: Mebarak\nA Second family name, traditionally it’s the First family name of the mother: Ripoli\n\nTo speak to someone:\n\nin informal settings one just uses the first name: “hey, Shakira!”;\nin semiformal settings (like a teacher in elementary school), one uses the first name and first family name: “Hello, Shakira Mebarak!”;\nand in very formal settings or documents one uses the full name “Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoli”.\n\n\n\nThe French language convention for names:\nFrench uses a different convention, a name (nom) consists of just two parts: a first name (prénom) and a family name (nom (de famille)).\nEmannuel Macron’s full name is Emmanuel Jean-Michel Fréderic Macron.\nHere, the name is divided like this:\n\nPrénom: Emmanuel Jean-Michel Fréderic\nNom (de famille): Macron\n\nAs we can see, the Prénom may contain many simple names.\n\n\nFrom Spanish naming into French naming\nSo when Shakira wants to make a concert in France, how should she fill her taxes?\nHere she could take advantage of the format of Passports.\nMany Spanish speaking countries print their passports combining the First and Middle names into a single “Simple Names” field, and the First and Second family names into a single “Family Names” field.\nTherefore, the conversion into the French format is natural:\nShe could use her First and Middle names together as a Prénom, and her First and Second family names as a Nom (de famille).\nShakira would fill her French taxes as follows:\n\nPrénom: Shakira Isabel\nNom (de famille): Mebarak Ripoli\n\nNote that this decision will have practical consequences for Shakira: While in Spanish the Middle names are rarely used, now she will have to use them very often for French bureaucracy.\nIn general, if you don’t stick to the name you’ve chosen for your target language, you will run into a lot of trouble because people will not be able to easily verify your identity.\n\n\nDifferent Scripts\nIf your target country uses a different script than your home country for documents (Latin script, Arabic script, Cyrillic script, Greek script, Devanagari script, etc.), then you will have an extra layer of bureaucratic difficulty.\nThe most safe but expensive way to deal with this is to have official translations (maybe with an Apostille), see which conventions they use to transcribe/transliterate things like your name or the name of your university, and continue using them everywhere.\n\nFor example, from this Wikipedia entry, the common name “Γιάννης” can be written as Yannis, Jani, Ioannis, Yianis, or Giannis, but not Giannes.\nFor example, the Russian naming convention includes a patronymic inside full names, and also uses the Cyrillic script!\n\nAs I said, you have to figure out the name you’ll use abroad.\n\n\n\n\nInformation Labyrinths\nGovernment information is convoluted:\n\nGet ready to read everything at least three times.\n\nIt will not make any sense by the first read. You’ll be confused by the bureaucratic gibberish, the unhelpful forum posts, and the broken links. Little by little, you’ll start to see how everything connects.\nThis is harder if you’re going to a place that speaks another language. Even the most international-friendly countries have their websites with tons of links for information only available in the local language.\nThe most helpful method is to find someone who has already done what you did and wants to help, or to look for information online (like this blog!)\n\n\n\nMoney talks\nWhen talking about money we need to be serious.\nLearn how to make an international transaction from your home country. Go to you bank and ask them for all the necessary paperwork. However, don’t hesitate to ask around many banks and see which has a better deal for international transactions.\nFor example, in my country, very few banks work with Euros easily, so I had to search for one where I could at least save them without converting them into another currency.\nAlso, look for good places to exchange currency! In my experience banks tend to have the worst possible deals! I prefer currency exchange houses, one can ask around many of them to get a good deal. Virtual currency exchanges and using crypto are getting popular, but I’ve not used them yet.\n\nClosing all you bank accounts when leaving is a bad idea\n\nThey are useful for sending money back, and paying for local bureaucracy easily. So leave one or two accounts you can use.\nHow will your taxes work once you stop living in your home country? Is there anything you need to do to avoid being taxed? This information is important, and varies from place to place. For example, most countries don’t tax their citizens once they are residents abroad, yet one of the big exceptions is the USA.\n\n\n\nNavigation apps\nTo get around, Google Maps is very trustworthy. It even lets you download maps for offline use!\nFor public transport, I’ve found Moovit to be very well done. Instead of downloading a local app for each city you go to, Moovit has a decent summary of most cities.\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous\nFind out the address format (for houses, mail, etc) of the place you’re going to.\nCheck electricity specifications, like plug shape, voltage and frequency, to know if you’ll need to buy adapters or transformers. Extensions are a good idea.\n\nSafe travels!"

    "title": "Writing a Motivation Letter",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Writing a Motivation Letter\n\nGet ready to do everything from scratch at least two times.\n\nYou’ll find a lot of advice and tricks on writing motivation letters, but that one was the most useful to me: It helped me get into the mindset for writing a motivation letter that really reflected what I wanted.\n\nAt the end of this post I’ll upload the Motivation Letters I used.\n\n\n\nWhat isn’t a Motivation Letter for?\n\nA Motivation Letter isn’t a document you use to trick the election committee into picking you. If you overstate or oversell something, they will know. Yet at the same time, don’t undersell yourself. Be honest: you want them to see if you’ll do well in the Master’s, and if you really believe it, they’ll see it through your writing.\nIt also is not a place to recount how well you did on your courses: that’s what course transcripts are for!\n\n\nWhat is a Motivation Letter for?\nA motivation letter will show the election committee what you’ve done, what you’re abilities are, if there are notable parts of your academic history, how do you see the Master’s program they’re offering, and what do you plan to do with that.\n\n\n\nPart zero: Don’t wait till last minute.\nIt is a common mistake to leave the Motivation Letter to the very end. That shows an lack of knowledge about the intensity of this step, and will lead to a bad motivation letter.\n\n\n\n\nPart one: Discovering what you want\nDon’t jump to write your Motivation letter.\nFirst you have to face the mirror.\nWhy do you want to pursue a Master’s program? Are you ready to invest those two years? What for? What will you do if you don’t get in? What career prospects do you expect?\nThese questions will accompany all the way till you hit “Send” on the application to the program, and will make you scrap and rewrite a lot.\nOf course, you should not wait until you have an exact schedule of what you’re going to do with your life, instead, the idea is to get a general sense of what you want for your future.\nIn my case, something that helped me discover this was to search in LinkedIn for the Alumni of the Master’s programs that interested me. I could watch the life and career paths that different Master’s programs opened and closed. This was more concrete information than, say, the Wikipedia overview of the topics of the Master’s.\n\n\n\nPart two: The mindset\nThink as if you were in the election committee: You have hundreds of motivation letters to read and grade, the ones who go on tangents, or mention very general things (e.g. “I am good at abstract reasoning”), won’t make a good impression and will feel like a waste of time.\nBe precise and concrete: point to real evidence that cannot be found in the other documents.\nThe only part where you’re allowed to be kind of vague is when you explain your expectations for your future after the Master’s.\n\nPersonalize them: Ideally you’ll write a different motivation letter for each master.\n\nTo do this, you should have a general idea of what the university and the Master’s offer. Even if two universities offer Master’s with the same name, they’ll have different strengths and weakness in research, industry presence, and study areas. So, check them out.\n\n\n\nPart three: Structure of the Motivation Letter\nI’ll go through this one by one. Depending on your writing style, group them in paragraphs as you see fit.\n\nDon’t lose the attention of the reader: Straight away tell them why are you applying and a general idea of what you want to learn and what to do with it.\nGive a general introduction to your background. Apart from mentioning your major, mention the things that don’t appear on the other documents: research, academic, or university projects, activities, or events; how those activities impacted you and your abilities, and what particular academic path you’ve been following.\nTalk a little about yourself. There are no other places where the election committee can get a glimpse into your personality. However, don’t forget to relate it to the particular Master’s program.\nTell them about your current situation. Are you a student? When are you going to graduate from your Bachelor’s? Have you already graduated? What’s your job (if it’s relevant to the program)? What have you learned recently (life-wise, not academic-wise) that can help you in the Master’s?\nWhat would you like to do after finishing your Master’s? This part shows them that you do intend to finish it! Do you want to pursue an academic or industry career? Do you not know yet? This in the only part where you are allowed to be vague or a little literary, but don’t overdo it!\n\n\n\n\nPart four: Improve and polish it\nAt some points you’ll have to discard parts that took a lot time to write but that you can no longer fit in the letter, or maybe even discard the whole letter and start over. That’s o.k., it’s part of the process.\n\n\n\nPart five: Send it!\n\nGood luck!\n\n\n\n\nMy samples\nThese are the motivation letters I sent to the Master’s programs I applied to\n\nLCT - Language and Communication Technology Erasmus Master letter\nMathmods - Mathematical Modeling in Engineering letter\nKTH Sweden - Computer Simulation for Science and Engineering letter\nKTH Sweden - Applied Computational Mathematics letter"

It takes two weeks to get one. The fare per ride is around 0.60€.\nYouth Mugi Card: Like the Personalized Mugi Card, but for people under 25. You need empadronamiento for this one. The fare per ride is around 0.40.\nAnonymous Mugi Card: The most general Mugi Card. You can just buy and use it. The fare per ride is around 0.80.\n\nAll Mugi Cards cost 5.00€.\n\nSo, during your first days in Donostia, it is very convenient to just buy an Anonymous Mugi Card and use it until you figure out how to get one of the other ones.\n\nWhere to get the Anonymous Mugi Card?\nThere are a lot of small shops around Donostia where you can buy and charge a Mugi Card. Just walk around until you see one. If you prefer to know a specific place, I know you can buy them in this small library:\n\n\n\n\nWhere to charge your Mugi Card?\n\nBy cash: in a lot of shops around Donostia. Just walk around and you’ll find them.\nBy card:\n\nIn Kutxabank ATMs\nIn the central bus station\nIn the Euskotren (tram) stations\n\n\n\n\nHow to get a personalised MUGI card?\nThe official website does not include instructions in English, as of 2023.\nIn order to get a personalised MUGI card, as a foreigner, you will have to ask for it in person.\nFirst, go to the MUGI office next to the Amara metro station. Here you will get the appropiate form for requesting a personalized MUGI card.\n\n\n\nYou can make an appointment in their website, however, this is not mandatory. You can just show up and wait for a while.\nTake your passport and an ID photo with you.\nThey will give you a form for requesting the card. If you are lucky, they will help you fill out the form.\n\nSecond, you have to take this form to a shop that handles the delivery of MUGI cards. There are several shops like this around Donostia. One of the shops closest to the Amara station is the small library mentioned above. Here is where you deposit your form and pay 5€.\n\n\nThird, wait around 10 days for your card to arrive to the shop.\nWhy is it so complicated? Well, there is an online application process, however, it is designed for Spanish citizens with and official address (empadronamiento). Everybody else has to go through the long process.\nNote that, if you are younger than 25 years, then, after you get your empadronamiento, you will be able to get a Youth MUGI card, which gives you an extremely low price."

There are regional buses from Donostia to this airport.\n\n\n\n\nThe Vitoria-Gasteiz airport, which hosts RyanAir, with a lot of connections. To get to this airport, you can take a regional bus to Vitoria-Gasteiz, taking one hour and a half, and then a bus for 20 minutes."

This is what Campus France exists for.\nCampus France is a service from the French Government dedicated to: - handling the applications of foreing students to French Universities. Since I was coming from an Erasmus Mundus program, I did not have to go through the proccess of applying through Campus France. - analyzing foreign academic qualifications (like university Diplomas) and decide on its equivalent in the French educational system.\nAfter deciding on the qualifications of a candidate, they emit a certificate, which is later used by the French embassy for the Visa application.\nNot all countries must go through the Campus France process when applying for a French Visa, for example, Canada has their own procedure."

For example, I get to be registered as a student of the Université de Lorraine for the first year.\nThis means that, for the French educational system, the enrolment is made into the Université de Lorraine, so that’s what one has to select in the Études en France platform. (This was confusing at the beginning because I kept looking everywhere in the platform for a “LCT Master” but could find none)\nAs it happens, in the French system, unlike other educational systems, Master’s technically do not last two years. Instead, they are two educational programs of one year, the “M1” and the “M2”, which are supposed to be taken in sequence.\nAs I was going for my first year to the Université de Lorraine as an LCT student, technically I was getting into the M1 program.\nAll of this boils down to the fact that the Études en France platform, being from the French government, expects a French higher education program. I had to look up the official name of the program on the university website, which is the Master 1 Traitement Automatique des Langues at the IDMC (Institute des sciences du Digital)"

Estancia is an intermediate status between a tourist and a resident. For example, people with Estancia are allowed to work, but cannot use the public health system.\nWhy is this important?\n\nnon-EU foreign students can only get Estancia.\nEU citizens can get a Residencia just by moving to Spain.\nIn principle, non-EU foreign students can change their Estancia to a Residencia only after finishing their studies.\nFor the purpose of getting Spanish nationality, only the time under Residencia counts, not the time under Estancia."

For example, if you ask for an extension of your permit, and it is approved after the expiration date of your current permit, then you will get a document from the Foreigners Office saying that you are legally allowed to be in Spain, even when you do not have a valid TIE yet (of course, you wwill have to request a new TIE at the Police as soon as possible).\nAnother weird situation is that there are procedures from the Foreigners Office which ask you to deposit the documents at the Police Office. Then, when you get an answer about your procedure, it will be writen by the Foreigners Office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Foreigners Office has a decent digital platform, called MERCURIO, where most bureaucracy can be done online.\nThe Police Office requires most of it bureaucracy to be done in person."

If you want to apply online, which accelerates the processing of the application, you will need a Digital Certificate. However, as a non-EU foreigner, you can only get a personal Digital Certificate once you have a TIE. Thus, you would need an immigration lawyer to use their Digital Certificate to make the application on your behalf. This is expensive.\nWhen your Authorization is approved (which is almost certain if you fulfill all the requirements), you will get a Resolución (Resolution or Decision). In this Resolución the Foreigners Office will give you the right to stay in Spain.\nProcessing the application takes at most one month. If you do not get an answer within a month, it means the application was rejected.\nIn the rare case that your application is rejected, you will be given two weeks to leave Spain. However, an immigration lawyer can help you contest this decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThe favorable Resolución proofs that you have the right to stay in Spain.\n\n\n\nAfter getting the Resolución, you need to get a TIE.\n\n\nYou are European\nJust by being from the European Union, you have the right to live and work in any other Member State of EU.\nTo prove that you have the right to stay in Spain, you have to register as a European Citizen living in Spain, by requesting an inscription into the Foreigners’ Central Register (Registro Central de Extranjeros).\nThis request is made by the procedure called “Certificate of Inscription of European Union Citizens” (Certificado de Registro de Ciudadanos de la Unión Europea). In Donostia, this is done at the Police Office.\nThe website mentioned above (from the Polytechnic University of Catalunya) goes into the finer details for this procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nThis procedure is very straightforwad and simple.\nOnce you go to your appointment at the Police Office and present all your documents, you will immediately be assigned a NIE and given an Inscription Certificate (Certificado de Registro … UE), which is a small and green paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Certificado de Registro … UE proofs that you have the right to stay in Spain.\n\n\n\nAs a European citizen, you do not have to get a TIE."
